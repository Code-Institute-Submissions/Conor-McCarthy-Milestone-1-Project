# SILENCE 

The objective of this website is to attract potential customers into downloading the Silecne meditation app via this well put together website. I give snippets of freely available infomation via the How to Meditate page and answer some of the more obvious queries in my questions page. I have also provided recommendations on the index.html from esteemed teachers in the field.

## UX

As stated previously, the goal of the website is to convince the customer to download the the Silence application. I believe an application to be the superior product for a meditation type product. That doesn't mean you should skimp out on the website, a good first impression is key. Below, I have several different types of customers who require answers and ill explain how this website achieves its goal in answering their questions.

Curious user:They would ask "why use this application over any other?". For the most part, this is answered in the index.html. I've offered the user by offering a free trial which they can see clearly straight away in the header. Not only that, just below I give 3 presentable statements with some context in what I called the "entice section. This is further reinforced in the "why use silence" section that gives a brief reasoning why you should use this app over any other. They might still not convinced, so I have one last ditch effort where I have presented 3 quotes from established meditators giving a brief description of who they are and I've added clickable links on their name and icons to an external website explaining who they are.

Semi on board user: At this point, the user might think "ok im not up for downloading the app just yet but I want to learn some basic tips". Their needs can be satisfied in the "howtomediate.html" page. I divided the content in a 3 step process presenting great imagery with matching colours in the container. The goal here is they take away this infomation themselves, like the results they're seeing and download the app with the free trial, eventually they should (hopefully) become full time customers.

skeptical user: The user just isnt convinced at all to download the app or take in the meditation instructions but is at least open minded enough to check the Q&A. This should (hopefully) let them question their doubts over the whole idea and download the application.

Convinced user: They like what they see and want the app. They need only to press the free trial button and a form will pop up where they must present their infomation. They need only click commence free trial.




## FEATURES

 ### -FOR ALL PAGES:

Navbar- styled the same as the header for a smooth look. Will allow you the user to go to the homepage, go to the other pages on the site, a clickable icon that brings you to the main content of the page and most importantly, a free trial button.

### -howtomeditate.html:

steps: 3 different rows presenting visually pleasing colours and images. There is a row for each step involved.


### -questions.html:

q&a: questions are presented neatly in this page and the answers are hidden behind an accordion to prevent visual clutter on the page.

FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT

Smooth transation upon pressing the anchor arrow: Upon research it required JS which is beyon the scope of this lesson.The idea was to make it have a scrolling animation.

changing icons in q&a:I wanted the blue gate icons to instead be a plus icon, upon clicking it, it'd smoothly transition into a minus. Again, something of this technicality was beyond what I've learned so far. Javascript was probably needed to make this feature functional.

I had also wanted to make privacy policy plus a terms and conditions page but I had ran out of time to do so. I dont think there would be any technical difficulties doing so.

Lastly, I wanted to add more functionality to the forms, but I only went as far as the demostrations went on code institute.
